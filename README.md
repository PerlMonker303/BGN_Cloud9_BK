# API

API application that serves all the request from the customer UI application.

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:PerlMonker303/BGN_Cloud9_BK.git
cd BGN_Cloud9_BK
npm install
npm start
```

You will also need to create a `.env` file in the root of the directory (same place as the `index.js`
which basically stores the envionment variables with details used to connect to the db. It can be found on the 
`back-end` tex chanel for discord.
